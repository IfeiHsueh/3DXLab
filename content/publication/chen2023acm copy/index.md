abstract: To augment the TV show in post-production, we propose a novel solution to uncalibrated camera small motion tracking in a dynamic scene that simultaneously reconstructs the sparse 3D scene and computes camera poses and focal lengths of each frame. The critical elements of our approach are a robust image feature tracking strategy in dynamic scenes followed by automatic local-window frames slicing, local and global bundle adjustment optimization initialized by a homography-based uncalibrated relative rotation solver. The proposed method allows us to add the virtual objects (elements) into the reconstructed 3D scene, then composite them back into the original shot while perfectly matched perspective and appear seamless. The evaluation of a large variety of real TV show sequences demonstrates the merits of our method against state-of-the-art works and commercial software products.
